#Virtual Controller Driver#

Virtual Controller Driver simulates a single OpenVR controller.

## Why?

This allows you to create mixed reality videos with only two controllers.
The code also serves as a very simple example of how to create an OpenVR controller driver.

## Installation

The output file should be named driver_virtualcontroller.dll and should be in the SteamVR/drivers/virtualcontroller\bin\Win32 folder.

Example full path to dll:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\virtualcontroller\bin\Win32\driver_virtualcontroller.dll
    
## Usage

* Start/Restart SteamVR.

After a few seconds you should see a third controller appear like so:

The third controller will look like a Generic HMD inside SteamVR. Because its position is hardcoded to (0, 0, 0) and cannot be changed it will appear exactly where a lighthouse is (if used with a Vive).

## How to create mixed reality videos?

There are two approaches:

* Use the virtual controller as your first controller, attach one of your Vive controllers to your physical camera. This means you can only use one controller in you game, but allows the camera to be moved while recording and is the easiest to setup.
* Use the virtual controller as the third controller. This allows you to use both Vive controllers while recording. Because this virtual controller cannot currently be moved, it means that the position and rotation of your camera must be entered into externalcamera.cfg. I'm currently working on a tool that will allow you to find the position and rotation of a physical camera.
